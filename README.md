# Rust Websockets
This is a project created in an attempt to learn more about Rust and Async workflows. No guarantees are provided.

## Outcomes
1. **Understanding WebSockets:**
   Familiarize yourself with the WebSocket protocol. Understand how the handshake works, the difference between WebSocket and HTTP, and the basic message framing.
2. **Choosing a WebSocket Library:**
   Decide on a WebSocket library for Rust. There are several options available, such as tokio, async-std, and websocket. Choose one that aligns with your project requirements and your familiarity with async programming in Rust.
3. **Project Structure:**
   Plan your project structure. Divide the code into manageable modules. Consider creating separate modules for handling WebSocket connections, managing state, and handling incoming messages.
4. **Async Programming:**
   Since WebSockets are inherently asynchronous, ensure that you are comfortable with Rust's async programming model. Familiarize yourself with async/await syntax and how it integrates with the chosen library.
5. **Error Handling:**
   Rust places a strong emphasis on error handling. Plan how you will handle errors gracefully. Consider using the Result and ? operator effectively.
6. **WebSocket Server:**
   Implement the WebSocket server. Handle the WebSocket handshake, manage connections, and implement the logic for sending and receiving messages.
7. **WebSocket Client:**
   Implement the WebSocket client. Ensure that it can connect to the server, perform the handshake, and send/receive messages. Consider implementing a way to gracefully close connections.
8. **Security Considerations:**
   Be aware of security considerations when working with WebSocket connections. Implement proper authentication mechanisms if needed and validate incoming messages to prevent security vulnerabilities.
9. **Testing:**
   Write comprehensive tests for your WebSocket server and client. Consider using Rust testing frameworks like tokio-test or async-std-test.
10. **Documentation:**
    Document your code thoroughly. Include information about how to use your WebSocket server and client, expected inputs/outputs, and any configuration options.
11. **Logging:**
    Implement logging to facilitate debugging and monitoring. Consider using the log crate and configure a logging backend appropriate for your project.
12. **Performance Optimizatiozsn:**
    Depending on your project requirements, consider optimizing the performance of your WebSocket server. This might involve tuning parameters, using connection pools, or implementing other performance-enhancing strategies.
